                <h1>What is DOM? What is purpose of DOM?</h1>
                <p>DOM is an acronym that stands for Document Object Model. Itâ€™s how a web browser represents a web page internally.
                The DOM determines what content should be on a page and how each element of the content relates to the other elements.
                The purpose of DOM is to maintain a standard programming interface for HTML and XML documents, which is language-independent. Setting and maintaining this standard enables programmers to create or navigate these types of documents and modify their elements predictably, using any type of language or development environment.

                <h1 class="mt-6">How to select elements from DOM?</h1>
                <p>There are 5 ways in which we can select elements in a DOM using selectors. They are:
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>1. getElementsByTagName()</li>
                        <li>2. getElementsByClassName()</li>
                        <li>3. getElementById()</li>
                        <li>4. querySelector()</li>
                        <li>5. querySelectorAll()</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </div>

                <h1 class="mt-6">What is event bubble?</h1>
                <p>When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.</p>

                <h1 class="mt-6">What is callback function and its usages?</h1>
                <p>A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution. A more formal definition would be - Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function.
                A callback's purpose is to execute code in response to an event. These events can be like mouse clicks; with callback, we can add text at the end of each statement like"execute this code every time the user clicks a key on the keyboard."
